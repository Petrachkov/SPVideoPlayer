# SPVideoPlayer
Sample demo how to use AVVideoPlayer and add custom media tool bar. Project is in progress. 

Customer wanted custom tool bar for ieo player. Not the original one. So here we are.
Images used here are roughly perfect, as well as controls layout. But this demo shows how to work with avplayer in swift.
I've looked through apple official demo written in objC and got upset about absence of swift example. Not that i'm a huge fan of swift, but people seem to like it, and customer likes it too.

To be developed:
transition from portrait to landscape and back
